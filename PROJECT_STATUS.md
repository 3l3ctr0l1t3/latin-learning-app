## 🐛 Bug Status

### 🔴 Critical (0)
None

### 🟡 Major (0)
None - Fixed dropdown issue!

### 🟢 Minor (3)
1. Dropdown flickers on fast typing
2. Mobile keyboard overlap on some devices
3. No loading states for async operations

---

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **Bundle Size**: ~500KB (acceptable)
- **Load Time**: <2s local (good)
- **Lighthouse Score**: Not measured
- **Component Render**: <16ms (smooth)

---

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### What's Working Well ✅
- Component-based architecture is clean
- TypeScript catches errors early
- Hot reload is fast
- Canvas approach helps testing

### Pain Points ⚠️
- No automated tests
- No CI/CD pipeline
- Manual imports (no auto-import)
- No code formatting standards

---

## 📝 Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths 💪
- **Extensive Comments**: Every component heavily documented
- **TypeScript Usage**: Proper typing throughout
- **Component Design**: Good separation of concerns
- **Reusability**: Components are properly abstracted

### Areas for Improvement 📈
- **No Tests**: 0% test coverage
- **State Management**: Need centralized state
- **Error Handling**: Minimal error boundaries
- **Performance**: No memoization or lazy loading

## 💭 Developer Notes

The project is in good shape architecturally. The component-based approach is working well, and the extensive documentation is helpful for learning. The main challenge now is completing the study session flow, which is the core feature. Once that's done, the rest should fall into place quickly.

The dropdown bug is finally fixed! The solution was to prevent the search effect from running when removing words and to explicitly close the dropdown during removal.

Ready to start building the actual study session screens!
